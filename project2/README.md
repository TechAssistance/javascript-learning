# Cat (finally on windows) 
The mission is simple, create the "cat" command on would use in unix/linux systems on windows. In JavaScript. 
Requirments: 
1. Take any file type and read the contenst to console / stdout 
2. Read the file in order (top to bottom) 
3. See if we can potentially compile it??? (no clue if possible)
4. Read from file provided from user input

# The Research we done did: 
1. Google for ways to interact with files in JS 
- found this: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/fs.html
- more specifically: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/fs.html#filehandlereadfileoptions
2. Look at node docs for taking in user input.

3. Find ways to compile Node.Js apps! 
- found: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg
