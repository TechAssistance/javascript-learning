# Cat (finally on windows) 
The mission is simple, create the "cat" command on would use in unix/linux systems on windows. In JavaScript. 
Requirments: 
1. Take any file type and read the contenst to console / stdout 
2. Read the file in order (top to bottom) 
3. See if we can potentially compile it??? (no clue if possible)
4. Read from file provided from user input
5. Use Node.JS as this is meant to run on the system/server

# The Research we done did: 
1. Google for ways to interact with files in JS 
- found this: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/fs.html
- more specifically: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/fs.html#filehandlereadfileoptions
2. Look at node docs for taking in user input.
- found this: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/process.html#processargv
3. Find ways to compile Node.Js apps! 
- found: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg

Note:
I WAS able to compile them using the pkg command from npm. (they way too thiccc to add to a zip just in here  but it did work, dont think I'll want to compile nodeJS or use it for CLI applications in the future lol.
